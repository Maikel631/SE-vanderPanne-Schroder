 * FILE:  duplication.rsc
 *        This file contains functions to calculate the number of lines of
 *        code that occurs more than once in equal code blocks of at least
 *        6 lines. In our methods, these blocks are referred to as 'snippets'.
 *
 *        The percentage of all code that consists of duplicated code is then
 *        calculated and turned into a 1-5 score using a scoring table.
 *
 * USAGE: import 'codeProperties::duplication' to use the functions.
