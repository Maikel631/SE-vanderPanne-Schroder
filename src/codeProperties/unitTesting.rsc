 * FILE:  unitTesting.rsc
 *        This file contains functions to calculate the unit test coverage of
 *        an eclipse project. This is the percentage of lines of code that is
 *        called (directly or indirectly) by the unit tests written for the
 *        project.
 *
 * USAGE: import 'codeProperties::unitTesting' to use the functions.
